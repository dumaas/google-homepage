Brief Introduction of Project:
    My task was to deconstruct and rebuild the Google homepage with HTML and CSS.

Demonstrated Skills:
- Familiarity with Firefox devtools
- Understanding of basic HTML webpage structure
- Able to effectively link HTML structure with CSS stylesheet
- Attention to detail!

How was this project for me?
    Overall I really enjoyed the project! Because of the repetitive nature of using devtools to reconstruct a site, I quickly became familiar with standard HTML and CSS tasks and custimization. Although I didn't enjoy how repetitive and monotonous this project was, I found much value in it. This project allowed me to apply the basics of HTML and CSS and cement my learning!
